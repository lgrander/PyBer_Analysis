# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to disect the ride sharing data in order to determine key metrics that would allow V. Isualize to compare rural, suburban, and urban cities' rides. The key metrics that were identified and used to develop the analysis is as follows total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as average fares per ride and per driver. 

## Results
Utilizing  the key metrics we were easily able to compare total rides, drivers, and fares, as well as average fares per ride and per driver ralative to the city type.

### City Type Summary
Several trend from the City Type Sumary can be deduced.For example in Urban cities: -Total rides, total fares, and total drivers all increased, likely due to the higher population -Average fare per ride and average fare per driver all decreased. We can tell that population has a positive corrilation to total rides, fares and drivers. Population has a negative corrilation to Average fare per ride and per driver. 

### Weekly PyBer Fare Summary
From the total weekly fares we can see that  dispite the higher ride fares in the rural areas the Urban total fares are significatly higher than the other city types.

## Summary
Considerations for business improvement

- The Rural cities fare is the lowest of the other two city types (Urban and Suburban cities), in addition, fares never intersect. Knowing that all fares never intersect, we can expand fares and increase business financial income to the company

- Consider increasing the fare in urban areas for more profit since almost 2/3 of rides are in urban areas

- Consider incentives to hire more suburban/rural drivers since the avg fare is so high. Whether this is to high demand or longer rides or some other factor should be investigated. If rides are more profitable then getting more rural/suburban business should be a top priority
